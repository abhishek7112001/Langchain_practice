A rhythmic pulse on ribbons of steel,
The steady turning of the wheel.
A whistle screams against the sky,
As sleepy towns go rushing by.

The window frames a fleeing scene,
Of dusty browns and emerald green.
The telegraph wires dip and rise,
Like ocean waves before the eyes.

Through tunnel dark and sunlit plain,
The relentless, driving force of train.
Until the brakes begin to sigh,
And bring us home beneath the sky.
